        <h2>Flying Experience</h2>
        <p>Aviation has always been one of my passions. I find the intricacies of flight fascinating, from the way aircraft are engineered to how they soar through the sky. Although I am not yet a pilot, my interest in aviation goes beyond just flying. I love studying different types of aircraft, their mechanics, and their history.</p>

        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Obtain my private pilot license and learn to fly solo.</li>
            <li>Participate in a cross-country flight and explore different regions from the sky.</li>
            <li>Gain a deeper understanding of aircraft engineering and the technology behind flight systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Aviation Inspires Me</h3>
        <p>Learning about aviation is not just about flying; it's about understanding the human ingenuity behind every aircraft. The history of flight, from the Wright brothers' first flight to modern-day jets, is a testament to human perseverance and innovation. Aviation connects the world, bringing people and cultures together in ways unimaginable before the advent of flight.</p>
