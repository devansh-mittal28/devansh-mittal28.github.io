        <h2>Sports and Adventure</h2>
        <p>Two of my favorite hobbies include tennis and aviation. Both are exciting and challenging in their own ways. Here's a quick overview of what makes these hobbies so special to me:</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Tennis: A Passion</strong></h3>
        <p>Tennis keeps me fit, sharp, and focused. It's an individual sport where strategy and stamina are key. The thrill of competition is unmatched. It also brings me closer to like-minded people who share the same passion for the sport. Whether playing recreationally or competitively, tennis helps me maintain physical and mental agility.</p>

        <h3><strong>Aviation: Soaring High</strong></h3>
        <p>I am passionate about learning about various aircraft and the fascinating world of aviation. While I don't know how to fly yet, I enjoy exploring different types of aircraft, their history, and the technological advancements that have shaped aviation today. Itâ€™s an exciting field that constantly evolves! I hope to pursue it further one day and even fly a plane myself!</p>
